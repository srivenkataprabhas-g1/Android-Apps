Unit  P — Introduction to Kotlin Basics

(as per the official Android course on developer.android.com) 
Android Developers

 What This Pathway Covers

This pathway teaches Kotlin fundamentals, including:

 How to write and run your first Kotlin program
 Using variables to store data
 Defining and calling functions
 Practicing these concepts with basic problems
 A quiz to test understanding
(This is the first step before you build Android apps with Compose.)

The key modules are:

Before you begin

 ) Your First Program in Kotlin
 Purpose

Learn how to write, compile, and run a Kotlin program.

 Core Concept

Every Kotlin application starts from a main() function — this is where execution begins. 
Android Developers

 Example
fun main() {
    println("Hello Kotlin!")
}


Explanation:

fun declares a function

main is the starting function

println() prints text to the output
(Useful for console programs and learning basics.) 
Kotlin

What you’ll see:
 The text "Hello Kotlin!" appears when you run the program.

 ) Create and Use Variables
 What Are Variables?

Variables store data (like numbers or text) that your program can use and modify. Kotlin is statically typed — the type of each variable is known at compile time. 
Kotlin

 Two Kinds of Variables
Keyword	Meaning	Can Change?
val	Immutable (read-only)	
var	Mutable (modifiable)	

Examples:

val greeting: String = "Hi Kotlin!"  // can't reassign
var count: Int =                   // can change


 When Kotlin can figure out the type automatically, you can omit it:

val name = "Android"   // String inferred
var points =        // Int inferred


Why val and var?

val protects data you don’t want to change

var lets you update it later 
Kotlin

 ) Create and Use Functions
 What Are Functions?

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. You define them once and call them whenever needed. 
TutorialsPoint

 Basic Function
fun sayHello() {
    println("Hello World")
}


Call it:

fun main() {
    sayHello()
}

 Function With Parameters
fun add(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    return a + b
}


Explanation:

a: Int, b: Int are parameters

: Int after parentheses is the return type

return gives back a value 
TutorialsPoint

 Single-Expression Function

Kotlin lets you write short functions more concisely:

fun multiply(a: Int, b: Int) = a  b


(Here Kotlin infers the return type automatically.) 
Kotlin

 ) Practice Problems (Concept Reinforcement)

In this section of the official course, you usually get hands-on exercises such as:

 Write a function that adds two numbers and prints a formatted result
 Create variables, modify them, and print outcomes
 Use functions to improve your code organization 
Android Developers

Why practice matters:
Doing small coding exercises makes the concepts stick and prepares you for real app development.

 ) Quiz + Badge

After finishing the lessons and practice, you take a quiz to:

 Test your understanding
 Earn a badge for completing the module 
Android Developers

 Helpful Examples

Here are common illustrative examples you might type in Kotlin:

 Example – Mutable vs Immutable
fun main() {
    val name = "Kotlin"
//  name = "Compose" //  Error: val cannot be reassigned

    var score = 
    score =          //  Works
    println(score)
}

 Function That Prints a Message
fun greetUser(user: String) {
    println("Welcome, $user!")
}

fun main() {
    greetUser("Alice")
}


Output:
Welcome, Alice!

 Function With Return Value
fun square(x: Int): Int {
    return x  x
}

fun main() {
    val result = square()
    println("Square is $result")
}

 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
 Q: Why do we use fun in Kotlin?

A: fun is the keyword that tells Kotlin you’re defining a function. Without it, the compiler won’t interpret your code as a function. 
TutorialsPoint

 Q: What’s the difference between val and var?

A:

val means the value cannot be changed after assignment

var allows reassignments
It’s a best practice to use val whenever possible to prevent accidental modifications. 
Kotlin

 Q: Do I have to declare types every time?

A: No — when you initialize a variable at declaration, Kotlin automatically infers the type for you. But if you declare without initializing right away, you must specify the type explicitly. 
Kotlin

 Q: What type of programs can I write with just these basics?

A: At this stage, you can write simple console programs (like calculators) or functions that do computations. Later you’ll use these skills to build real Android UIs with Jetpack Compose.

 Q: Why is Kotlin popular for Android development?

A: Kotlin is concise, expressive, safe (null safety), interoperable with Java, and is Google’s recommended language for Android apps.
